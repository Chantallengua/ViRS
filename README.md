# VIRS PROJECT

ViRS (Virtual Roman Shipwreck) is a project made for the course 'Museology, Museography and Virtual Environments' (prof. Caraceni) inside the Master of Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at University of Bologna. It aims to design a full museum where virtual experiences like AR, sensor projections and VR coexist and are enhanced by the presence of true historical artifacts, explanatory panels and guided tours.
